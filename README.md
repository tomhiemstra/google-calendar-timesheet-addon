## üìä How It Works

### Event Parsing

TimeTracker Buddy intelligently parses your Google Calendar events:

- **Job Numbers**: Looks for 5-digit numbers in event titles or descriptions
- **Client Names**: Extracts from patterns like "Client: ABC Corp" or analyzes description content
- **Job Phases**: Finds patterns like "Phase: Design" or "Job Phase: 1"
- **Task Types**: Categorizes based on keywords (meeting, development, design, etc.)

### Time Tracking

- Import entire weeks of calendar events with one click
- Manually add, edit, or delete time entries
- Categorize time as billable or non-billable
- Track time across multiple projects and clients

### Reporting

- Daily summaries with category breakdowns
- Weekly summaries with visual charts
- Export to CSV for invoicing
- Filter by category or client
